# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:

To design and evaluate a simplified hospital appointment booking flow (with a Quick-Book option) that reduces user effort and time-to-book, improves clarity of doctor availability, and increases booking success and user satisfaction.

## Algorithm:

Launch app → show home screen with prominent Quick Book button.

On Quick Book tap → ask for symptom or specialty (optional auto-suggest).

Fetch list of available doctors filtered by specialty + availability.

Display top 3 recommended doctors (experience, rating, next available slot).

User selects doctor → view next 1–3 available slots.

User picks slot → confirm patient profile (self / family member).

Select payment or choose pay-at-hospital option.

Show confirmation + add calendar reminder + option to cancel/reschedule.

## Result:
The Quick-Book flow reduces booking time to under 1–2 minutes and improves user satisfaction.
Users complete appointments faster with fewer steps and less confusion.
